# NVIDIA NeMo Fabric TypeScript Adapter Workspace

This private npm workspace coordinates the independently published common,
Cline, Pi, OpenCode, and Qwen Code adapter packages. It provides shared build, test,
package-content, and consumer-install checks without becoming a published
package itself.

## Build and Test

Run the following commands from the repository root:

```bash
just build-typescript
just test-typescript-adapters
```

The adapter test recipe builds the local TypeScript contract before it compiles
the adapter packages.

To install only the Pi adapter workspace and its exact-pinned development
harness, run:

```bash
just install-typescript-pi
```

To install only the Cline adapter workspace, run:

```bash
just install-typescript-cline
```

To install only the OpenCode adapter workspace and its exact-pinned development
harness, run:

```bash
just install-typescript-opencode
```

To install only the Qwen Code adapter workspace and its exact-pinned SDK, run:

```bash
just install-typescript-qwen
```

## Dependency Rationale

The workspace links `nemo-fabric-adapter-contract` from the checked-out source
tree so all adapter builds and tests use the contract being reviewed. Resolving
the package from the registry would test an older published contract, while
copying its schemas would create a second authority. This file dependency is
development-only; the published child manifests declare registry-safe contract
versions.

Pi and OpenCode harness SDKs are optional peers of their published adapters.
The Cline SDK is entirely caller-managed and is not declared in the adapter
manifest or workspace lockfile.

The OpenCode adapter runs with Bun 1.4.2 or later. Source and package checks
run its process lifecycle under Bun while using Node.js for TypeScript builds
and the shared workspace tooling.

The workspace overrides OpenCode's exact MCP client and core pins to `2.2.0`
for [GHSA-6qxp-vccf-f47h](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6qxp-vccf-f47h).
The real OpenCode process tests exercise HTTP MCP initialization, tool discovery,
model calls, and cleanup against these versions. Remove this scoped override
after the supported OpenCode release pins patched MCP packages itself. This
development-workspace override does not change a consumer's dependency graph;
consumers using OpenCode OAuth must also upgrade their MCP packages and follow
the advisory's credential-migration guidance.
