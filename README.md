NeMo Fabric gives applications, evaluation systems, and rollout platforms a consistent interface for running agent harnesses and custom agents.

- **Compose runs:** Configure models, tools, skills, MCP servers, subagents, and runtime settings consistently.
- **Validate before execution:** Detect unsupported configurations before starting a runtime.
- **Switch harnesses:** Reuse the consumer integration while adapters handle harness-specific behavior.
- **Compare outcomes:** Collect normalized results, errors, artifacts, lifecycle events, and telemetry references.

## Supported Agent Harnesses

NeMo Fabric includes adapters for the following harnesses and execution targets. Select a harness name for its adapter documentation:

| Agent Harness | Tool Policy | MCP | Skills | Telemetry |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [Claude Code](adapters/python/claude/README.md) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| [Cline](adapters/typescript/cline/README.md) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| [Codex](adapters/python/codex/README.md) | — | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| [Hermes Agent](adapters/python/hermes/README.md) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| [Kilo Code](adapters/typescript/kilo/README.md) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| [LangChain Deep Agents](adapters/python/deepagents/README.md) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

✅ Supported · — Not supported. Support may come through normalized configuration, native harness behavior, or a specific target. Refer to each adapter guide or the [complete compatibility matrix](adapters/README.md#configuration-compatibility) for details and limitations.

## NVIDIA Ecosystem

NeMo Fabric is an execution layer for NVIDIA products that build, evaluate, deploy, and improve agents. The ecosystem includes shipped integrations with [NVIDIA NeMo Helix](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/nemo-helix), concrete integrations with [NVIDIA NemoClaw](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/) and [NVIDIA NeMo Gym](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/gym), and emerging rollout integrations such as [NVIDIA Polar](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/ProRL-Agent-Server). [Explore the NeMo Fabric ecosystem](docs/about-nemo-fabric/ecosystem.mdx).

## Extensibility

NeMo Fabric separates consumers from execution targets through a stable, versioned contract. This makes it extensible in two directions:

- **Integrate a consumer:** Applications, evaluation systems, and rollout platforms use the Python SDK and typed `FabricConfig` to run different harnesses without implementing each harness integration. Start with the [consumer integration overview](docs/integrations/consumer/overview.mdx) or [consumer integration skills](skills/README.md).
- **Add an execution target:** Adapters translate the NeMo Fabric contract into the native behavior of a harness, framework, custom agent, or remote service. Start with the [adapter contract](docs/adapter-contract/README.md) and [adapter examples](docs/adapter-contract/examples.md).

## Documentation

- [Quickstart](docs/getting-started/quickstart.mdx): Run a first agent through the Python SDK.
- [Installation](docs/getting-started/install.mdx): Install the runtime, adapters, harness dependencies, and telemetry components, and choose a deployment scenario.
- [Adapter catalog](sdk/python/nemo-fabric-adapter-catalog/README.md): Inspect bundled adapter metadata on a host without installing harness SDKs.
- [Documentation overview](docs/about-nemo-fabric/overview.mdx): Understand the execution model and choose an interface.
- [Adapter reference](adapters/README.md): Compare adapter configuration, runtime, and observability support.
- [Contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md): Build, test, and contribute to the project.

## Roadmap

- **Expand the harness ecosystem:** Add high-priority first- and third-party harnesses through the normalized lifecycle and capability contracts.
- **Sandbox-native execution:** Run NeMo Fabric in secure environments through providers such as [NVIDIA OpenShell](https://docs.nvidia.com/openshell/about/overview).
- **Deepen NVIDIA ecosystem integrations:** Make NeMo Fabric a standard execution boundary for agent configuration, evaluation, rollouts, artifacts, and telemetry.
- **Enhance session lifecycle management:** Add explicit cold-start, resume, and fork operations with stable session identifiers and capability-aware errors.
- **Compose subagents:** Configure supported subagents through validated, portable NeMo Fabric configuration.
